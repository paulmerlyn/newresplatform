	<h2>Dividing Community Property</h2>
	<p class="text">Identifying what&rsquo;s separate property and what&rsquo;s community property is the easy part 
	in most cases. For example, the wife&rsquo;s Steinway piano inherited from her grandfather during her marriage 
	remains her separate property whereas retire-<br>
	ment accounts funded during the marriage are community property and therefore
	subject to division.</p>
	<p class="text">For property as for other aspects of a marital settlement &mdash; <a href="d_support.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_support.shtml'); return false;">child support</a>, 
	<a href="d_support.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_support.shtml'); return false;">spousal support</a>, and <a href="d_children.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_children.shtml'); return false;">children</a> &mdash; you 
	have a choice: You can either litigate, ultimately allowing a judge to decide who gets what, or you can settle 
	your own division of community property. Our professional mediators help spouses achieve an equitable division that 
	serves both their interests. Compare litigation with mediation and decide for yourself  which is the better way to 
	divide your estate.</p>
	<h2>Litigation</h2>
	<p class="text">Unless your  estate is extensive, you&rsquo;ll likely have to liquidate much of it to 
	pay your respective attorneys. But cost isn&rsquo;t the only reason to think twice before engaging your spouse 
	in litigation. A fight over property is emotionally exhausting, and the ensuing rancor can poison your relationship 
	forever. Community property litigation can also slow a divorce or legal separation while spouses squabble over 
	valuations and rightful ownership. And the  fees expended will often far exceed the 
	value of the disputed items.</p>
	<p class="text">In addition, you&rsquo;ll surrender <a href="l_empowerment.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('l_empowerment.shtml'); return false;">control</a> of the outcome, allowing a judge to make decisions 
	such as when and whether the family home should be sold and who should keep which items. Moreover, supposing an unwillingness 
	to settle before the trial date, a judge&rsquo;s ruling is likely to offend both your and your spouse&rsquo;s sense 
	of an equitable division.</p>
	<h2>Mediation</h2>
	<p class="text">Quite different from contest-oriented litigation, mediation approaches property division as a 
	set of problems or questions to resolve: What are the assets and debts in our estate? Which items are separate 
	property and which are community property? How can we determine fair valuations for each item of community 
	property? How should the community property be divided?</p>
	<p class="text">To help answer these questions,  parties may choose to meet as often as they wish with their <a href="m_mat.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('m_mat.shtml'); return false;">consultant attorneys</a> and other experts such as appraisers and CPAs. In this way, you retain control, agreeing only to a property division that you feel is fair. Furthermore, by avoiding the <a href="l_costs.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('l_costs.shtml'); return false;">cost</a> of litigation, the total professional fees for dividing your property will be considerably lower in mediation.</p>
	<p class="text">Couples frequently argue or withdraw when they try to talk to each other about a division of 
	property. Our skilled and experienced mediators will help you through such an impasse by reviewing 
	options such as:</p>
	<ul class="bulletv1">
	<li><span class="basictextbold">Cash buyout.</span> One party can acquire an item by purchasing the other party's interest in that item. <i>Example: 
	the wife pays the husband $35,000 from her separate property for an undivided interest in her (community property) company pension.</i></li>
	<li><span class="basictextbold">Sale or liquidation.</span> Some or all of the community estate can be sold and the proceeds allocated. <i>Example: 
	the vacation home is sold for $92,000 in equity after paying the balance on the mortgage and real-estate fees.</i></li>
	<li><span class="basictextbold">Barter or in-kind exchange.</span> Each party takes certain community property in exchange for yielding to the other party an interest in other items. <i>Example: the husband gains exclusive ownership of the truck and sailboat in exchange 
	for the minivan and the household furnishings.</i></li>
	</ul>
	<p class="text">Presuming you reach an agreement, your mediator will draft it as a <a href="d_msa.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_msa.shtml'); return false;">Memorandum of Understanding</a> 
	(MoU). This document describes the property division along with other proposed aspects of your  settlement in 
	clear language. You can each review the MoU with your consultant attorneys and make any changes as necessary.</p>
	<p class="text">You may then ask either our <!-- <a href="http://www.burkefamilylaw.net" onClick="wintasticthirdparty('http://www.burkefamilylaw.net'); return false;"> -->attorney-in-residence <!--</a> &mdash; Katherine Burke of <a href="http://www.burkefamilylaw.net" onClick="wintasticthirdparty('http://www.burkefamilylaw.net'); return false;">Burke Family Law</a> &mdash; -->or any other attorney on whom you both agree or a Legal Document Assistant to prepare a Marital Settlement Agreement based on your MoU for filing with the court.</p>
