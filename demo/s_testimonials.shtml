	<h1>A Word from Our Clients &hellip;</h1>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>&ldquo;Even after just our initial consultation, sitting and talking about our property was much easier.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;You made an inherently difficult experience easier. Thank you! I will gladly refer you to others.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Nothing could have made our experience better. Our mediator was really calm, warm, and impartial. He made us feel equal, and he treated us with the same interest in mind.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Even though our situation was straight-forward and quite amicable, I really appreciated the structure and clarity you provided.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The overall experience was a walk in the park. I would recommend New Resolution ... to anyone in need of this type of service.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Having you prepare our Memorandum of Understanding is making the legal work much quicker and saving money.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mediation made our divorce process possible. I knew from the beginning that a legal path could never have produced a solution.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I understand that neutrality is your goal, and I feel you accomplished it with heart and feeling.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mediation worked miracles for our family.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I know I felt very good about sharing these details about my/our lives with you. Very safe.  Thanks again.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Mediation helped us go through such a painful process in a civilized way &mdash; it helped us cover every aspect of a divorce, which was such unknown ground for us. It really allowed us to focus and cover every potential issue or question that could come up later.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;We feel blessed to have you assisting us.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Our case was simple [for our attorney] to handle thanks to the details of the MoU agreement that you prepared for us.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thank you for a wonderful guiding and peaceful approach during our sessions.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;It was a pleasure working with you, and I would recommend your services to anyone considering ending their marriage.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;One benefit is that we both feel we can carry on a friendship after the dust settles.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The mediation was very helpful!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I was given the opportunity to express my point of view and come to an agreement that we both could live with.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Nothing could have improved the mediation experience.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Very calming. Very respectful. Very effective since we were both given the opportunity to be heard. Seeing our assets on the white board was very helpful as well.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thank you for your expert assistance.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;[The mediator] was always so calm and made us feel at ease right from the beginning. I also appreciated the way he would address both parties on every issue and made sure we both agreed on what had been said (never took a silence for granted).&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What a great process!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The mediator helped keep both sides calm and focused.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I was impressed with your professionalism.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to know that empathy, organizational skills, logic and excellent communication skills can be used to help others.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&hellip; high quality, competent, empathetic and responsive &hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I had such low expectations of what could possibly be accomplished ... [the mediation] helped me not only achieve my most basic goals but also my wildest expectation goals.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The sessions were great, and I thank you for everything [you did] to get us through this tough time.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;&hellip; helpful, non-conflictual and cost-effective &hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thank you very much for your time and effort. Your service was well worth my time and expense. &hellip; I would certainly recommend you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Perfectly neutral and objective. Very good at reframing each point and at making sure none of the two parties' views overshadows the other. Also, constant validation of what was said. . Nobody felt rushed into accepting terms that they did not feel comfortable with.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thank you for helping our family so much.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The mediator was clear about not taking sides, but was also willing to help elucidate the truth of the situations.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Calm, fair and balanced. It felt safe.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I am thankful and grateful my husband agreed to try this process. I believe mediation has been a far better process than to litigate. Litigating would have been much more heart-wrenching than it has been.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Even during long sessions and disagreements with my wife, mediation was helpful and made things easier on both of us.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thank you very much for drafting our agreement. It looks great. I think you perfectly captured what we discussed.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Our attorney was impressed with the thoroughness of the MoU that we forwarded to her.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I appreciate your patience with us and your compassionate objectivity.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Your clear, concise, thoughtful manner helped build trust on both sides, which is the determining factor in how each side sees the agreement.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Our mediator was always calm and did not take sides. This really helped keep sessions under control.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I think mediation did a lot to let us know we weren&rsquo;t as much adversaries and could talk things through on our own.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Things were mutually agreed without too much fighting, and we all walked away satisfied.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Thanks for your help with our family.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I consulted an attorney to review the agreement. Her feedback is that you drew up an excellent document.  She commented that you covered all areas and composed the MoU in a way that made it easy to develop an MSA.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;We were very pleased with your work and your help. Thank you!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The tone that was set from the outset was collaborative, fair, and non-threatening.&rdquo;</li>
