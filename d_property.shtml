	<h2>Dividing Community Property</h2>
	<p class="text">Identifying what&rsquo;s separate property and what&rsquo;s community property is the easy part 
	in most cases. For example, the wife&rsquo;s Steinway piano inherited from her grandfather during her marriage 
	remains her separate property whereas retire-<br>
	ment accounts funded during the marriage are community property and therefore
	subject to division.</p>
	<p class="text">For property as for other aspects of a marital settlement &mdash; <a href="d_support.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_support.shtml'); return false;">child support</a>, 
	<a href="d_support.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_support.shtml'); return false;">spousal support</a>, and <a href="d_children.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_children.shtml'); return false;">custody</a> &mdash; you 
	have a choice: You can either litigate, ultimately allowing a judge to decide who gets what, or you can settle 
	your own division of community property. Our professional mediators help spouses achieve an equitable division that 
	serves both their interests. Compare litigation with mediation and decide for yourself  which is the better way to 
	divide your estate.</p>
	<h2>Litigation</h2>
	<p class="text">Unless your  estate is extensive, you&rsquo;ll likely have to liquidate much of it to 
	pay your respective attorneys. But cost isn&rsquo;t the only reason to think twice before engaging your spouse 
	in litigation. A fight over property is emotionally exhausting, and the ensuing rancor can poison your relationship 
	forever. Community property litigation can also slow a divorce or legal separation while spouses squabble over 
	valuations and rightful ownership. And the  fees expended will often far exceed the 
	value of the disputed items.</p>
	<p class="text">In addition, you&rsquo;ll surrender <a href="l_empowerment.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('l_empowerment.shtml'); return false;">control</a> of the outcome, allowing a judge to make decisions 
	such as when and whether the family home should be sold and who should keep which items. Moreover, supposing an unwillingness 
	to settle before the trial date, a judge&rsquo;s ruling is likely to offend both your and your spouse&rsquo;s sense 
	of an equitable division.</p>
	<h2>Mediation</h2>
	<p class="text">Quite different from contest-oriented litigation, mediation approaches property division as a 
	set of problems or questions to resolve: What are the assets and debts in our estate? Which items are separate 
	property and which are community property? How can we determine fair valuations for each item of community 
	property? How should the community property be divided?</p>
	<p class="text">To help answer these questions,  parties may choose to meet as often as they wish with their <a href="m_mat.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('m_mat.shtml'); return false;">consultant attorneys</a> and other experts such as appraisers and CPAs. In this way, you retain control, agreeing only to a property division that you feel is fair. Furthermore, by avoiding the <a href="l_costs.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('l_costs.shtml'); return false;">cost</a> of litigation, the total professional fees for dividing your property will be considerably lower in mediation.</p>
	<p class="text">Couples frequently argue or withdraw when they try to talk to each other about a division of 
	property. Our skilled and experienced mediators will help you through such an impasse by reviewing 
	options such as:</p>
	<ul class="bulletv1">
	<li><span class="basictextbold">Cash buyout.</span> One party can acquire an item by purchasing the other party's interest in that item. <i>Example: 
	the wife pays the husband $35,000 from her separate property for an undivided interest in her (community property) company pension.</i></li>
	<li><span class="basictextbold">Sale or liquidation.</span> Some or all of the community estate can be sold and the proceeds allocated. <i>Example: 
	the vacation home is sold for $92,000 in equity after paying the balance on the mortgage and real-estate fees.</i></li>
	<li><span class="basictextbold">Barter or in-kind exchange.</span> Each party takes certain community property in exchange for yielding to the other party an interest in other items. <i>Example: the husband gains exclusive ownership of the truck and sailboat in exchange 
	for the minivan and the household furnishings.</i></li>
	</ul>
	<p class="text">Presuming you reach an agreement, your mediator will draft it as a <a href="d_msa.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_msa.shtml'); return false;">Memorandum of Understanding</a> 
	(MoU). This document describes the property division along with other proposed aspects of your settlement in 
	clear language. You can each review the MoU with your consultant attorneys and make any changes as necessary before a legally binding <a href="d_msa.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_msa.shtml'); return false;">Marital Settlement Agreement</a> is filed with the court for a judge&rsquo;s approval.</p>

For example, the wife&rsquo;s Steinway piano inherited from her grandfather during her marriage remains her separate property whereas retirement accounts funded during the marriage are community property and therefore subject to division.</p>
	<p class="text">In most cases, the judge will award separate property to its associated spouse, and the presumption for division of community property is an equal share to each spouse. However, Washington provides few specific laws on how a judge must divide property as part of a <a href="d_divandsep.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_divandsep.shtml'); return false;">dissolution of marriage</a>, <a href="d_divandsep.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_divandsep.shtml'); return false;">legal separation</a>, or <a href="d_divandsep.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_divandsep.shtml'); return false;">declaration of invalidity</a>.

	<li>The economic circumstances of each spouse at the time the division of property is to become effective, including the desirability of awarding the family home or the right to live therein for reasonable periods to a spouse with whom the children reside the majority of the time.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="text">A judge can, for example, consider property acquired while spouses were living together before marriage when determining an equitable property division. A judge may also consider any disparity in their earning power after the marriage.</p>
	<p class="text">Identifying what&rsquo;s separate property and what&rsquo;s community property is the easy part in most cases.

	<li>The contribution of each party to the acquisition, dissipation, preservation, depreciation, or appreciation in the amount or value of the marital property, as well as the contribution of a party as a homemaker.</li>

	<p class="text">Identifying what&rsquo;s marital property and what&rsquo;s non-marital property is the easy part in most cases. For example, the wife&rsquo;s Steinway piano inherited from her grand-<br>father during her marriage is her separate non-marital property (unless she gifted it to her husband), whereas at least a portion of any retirement accounts funded from either spouse&rsquo;s income during the marriage will be marital property.</p>
	<p class="text">Pennsylvania courts generally undertake a three-step process in determining an equitable distribution of marital assets: (a) identify the marital (and non-marital) property in the estate; (b) value each asset and liability; (c) distribute the marital property in a fair manner in accordance with &sect;3502 of the Pennsylvania Domestic Relations Code (Title 23). The statute lists multiple factors for consideration, includ-<br>ing:</p> 
	<ul class="bulletv1">
		<li>The length of the marriage.</li>
		<li>Any prior marriage of either party.</li>
		<li>The age, health, station, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of each of the parties.</li>
		<li>The contribution by one party to the education, training, or increased earning power of the other party.</li>
		<li>The opportunity of each party for future acquisitions of capital assets and income.</li>
		<li>Sources of income of both parties, including, but not limited to, medical, retirement, insurance, or other benefits.</li>
		<li>The contribution or dissipation of each party in the acquisition, preservat-<br>ion, depreciation, or appreciation of the marital property, including the contribution of a party as homemaker.</li>
		<li>The value of the property set apart to each party.</li>
		<li>The standard of living of the parties established during the marriage.</li>
		<li>The economic circumstances of each party, including Federal, State, and local tax ramifications, at the time the division of property is to become effective.</li>
		<li>Whether the party will be serving as the custodian of any dependent minor children.</li>

	<h2>Litigation</h2>
	<p class="text">Unless your estate is extensive, you&rsquo;ll likely have to liquidate much of it to pay your respective attorneys. But cost isn&rsquo;t the only reason to think twice before engaging your spouse in litigation. A fight over property is emotionally exhausting, and the ensuing rancor can poison your relationship forever. Property litigation can also slow a divorce while spouses squabble over valuations and rightful ownership. And the fees expended will often far exceed the value of the disputed items.</p>
	<p class="text">In addition, you&rsquo;ll surrender control of the outcome, allowing a judge to make decisions such as when and whether the family home should be sold and who should keep which items. Moreover, supposing an unwillingness to settle before the trial date, a judge&rsquo;s ruling is likely to offend both your and your spouse&rsquo;s sense of an equitable division.</p>
	<h2>Mediation</h2>
	<p class="text">Quite different from contest-oriented litigation, mediation approaches property division as a set of problems or questions to resolve: What are the assets and debts in our estate? Which items are marital property and which are non-marital? How can we determine fair valuations for each item of marital property? How should the marital property be divided?</p>
	<p class="text">To help answer these questions, parties may choose to meet as often as they wish with their <a href="m_mat.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('m_mat.shtml'); return false;">consultant attorneys</a> and other experts such as appraisers and CPAs. In this way, you retain control, agreeing only to a property division that you feel is fair. Furthermore, by avoiding the <a href="l_costs.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('l_costs.shtml'); return false;">cost</a> of litigation, the total professional fees for dividing your property will be considerably lower in mediation.</p>
	<p class="text">Couples frequently argue or withdraw when they try to talk to each other about a division of property. Our skilled and experienced mediators will help you through such an impasse by reviewing options such as:</p>
	<ul class="bulletv1">
	<li><span class="basictextbold">Cash buyout.</span> One party can acquire an item by purchasing the other party's interest in that item. <i>Example: the wife pays the husband $35,000 from her separate (non-marital) property for an undivided interest in her (marital property) company pension.</i></li>

	<p class="text">When spouses divorce in Massachusetts, they can either devise their own property settlement or ask the court to order an equitable distribution according to the principles in the Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 208, <a href="http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/208-34.htm" onClick="wintasticthirdparty('http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/208-34.htm'); return false;">&sect;34</a>.</p>
	<h2>Property Division by a Judge</h2>
	<p class="text">In considering each of the factors in &sect;34, the judge has broad discretion over the weight of each factor and hence over the total distribution of property awarded to each spouse. Unlike in many states, where non-marital (separate) property (for example, property acquired by a spouse before the marriage) is not typically subject to division, Massachusetts allows judges to divide <i>all</i> property &mdash; wherever, whenever, and however acquired.</p>
	<p class="text">In consequence, property division by courts in Massachusetts is particularly difficult to predict. For long-term marriages (more than twenty years) in which one spouse was a home-maker, the court may be more likely to favor an equal division of property. And in short-term marriages without children, the court may favor divisions that restore to spouses, as nearly as possible, the property they each had before the marriage. But again, the division is on a case-by-case basis and may be quite unpredictable.</p>
	<p class="text">The property division factors are almost the same as those indicated for <a href="d_support.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_support.shtml'); return false;">alimony</a> in Massachusetts:</p>
	<ul class="bulletv1">
	<li>The length of the marriage.</li>
	<li>The conduct of the parties during the marriage (if the grounds for divorce are fault-based).</li>
	<li>The age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of the spouses.</li>
	<li>The opportunity of each spouse for further acquisition of capital assets and income.</li>
	<li>The present and future needs of any dependent children of the marriage.</li>
	<li>The contribution of each spouse to the acquisition, preservation, or appreciation in value of any property, including the contribution of each spouse as homemaker.</li>
	<li>The contribution of each spouse as a homemaker to the family unit.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="text">Unless your estate is extensive, you&rsquo;ll likely have to liquidate much of it to pay your respective attorneys in divorce litigation over property.

	<p class="text">Identifying what&rsquo;s marital property (including divisible property) and what&rsquo;s separate property is the easy part in most cases. For example, the wife&rsquo;s Steinway piano inherited from her grandfather during her marriage is her separate property (unless she gifted it to her husband), whereas at least a portion of any retirement accounts funded from either spouse&rsquo;s income during the marriage will be marital property.</p>
	<p class="text">In determining an equitable division of marital property, the judge must consider numerous factors identified in Chapter 50 <a href="http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_50/GS_50-20.html" onClick="wintasticthirdparty('http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_50/GS_50-20.html'); return false;">&sect;20</a> of the North Carolina General Statutes, including the following:</p>
	<ul class="bulletv1">
	<li>The income, property, and liabilities of each party at the time the division of property is to become effective.</li>
	<li>Any obligation for support arising out of a prior marriage.</li>
	<li>The duration of the marriage and the age and physical and mental health of both parties.</li>
	<li>The need of a parent with custody of a child of the marriage to occupy or own the marital residence and to use or own its household effects.</li>
	<li>The expectation of pension, retirement, or other deferred compensation rights that are not marital property.</li>
	<li>Any direct or indirect contribution made by one spouse to help educate or develop the career potential of the other spouse.</li>
	<li>Any direct contribution to an increase in value of separate property which occurs during the course of the marriage.</li>
	<li>The liquid or nonliquid character of marital and divisible property.</li>
	<li>The difficulty of evaluating any component asset or any interest in a business, corporation or profession, and the economic desirability of retaining such asset or interest, intact and free from any claim or interference by the other party.</li>
	<li>The tax consequences to each party</li>
	<li>Acts of either party to maintain, preserve, develop, or expand &mdash; or to waste, neglect, devalue, or convert &mdash; the marital or divisible property after the date of separation and before the time of distribution.</li>
	<li>Any other factor which the court finds to be just and proper.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="text">For property as for other aspects of a marital settlement &mdash; <a href="d_support.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_support.shtml'); return false;">child support</a>, <a href="d_support.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_support.shtml'); return false;">alimony</a>, and <a href="d_children.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('d_children.shtml'); return false;">custody</a> &mdash; you have a choice: You can either litigate, allowing a judge to decide the issue, or you can settle your own division of marital property. Our professional mediators help spouses achieve an equal or equitable division that serves both their interests. Compare litigation with mediation and decide for yourself which is the better way to divide your estate.</p>
	<h2>Litigation</h2>
	<p class="text">Unless your estate is extensive, you&rsquo;ll likely have to liquidate much of it just to pay your respective attorneys. But cost isn&rsquo;t the only reason to think twice before engaging your spouse in litigation. A fight over property is emotionally exhausting, and the ensuing rancor can poison your relationship forever. Property litigation can also slow a divorce while spouses squabble over valuations and rightful owner-<br>ship. And the fees expended will often far exceed the value of the disputed items.</p>
	<p class="text">In addition, you&rsquo;ll surrender control of the outcome, allowing a judge to make decisions such as when and whether the family home should be sold and who should keep which items. Moreover, supposing an unwillingness to settle before the trial date, a judge&rsquo;s ruling is likely to offend both your and your spouse&rsquo;s sense of an equitable division.</p>
	<h2>Mediation</h2>
	<p class="text">Quite different from contest-oriented litigation, mediation approaches property division as a set of problems or questions to resolve: What are the assets and debts in our estate? Which items are marital property, which are divisible propert, and which are separate? How can we determine fair valuations for each item of marital and divisible property? How should this property be divided?</p>
	<p class="text">To help answer these questions, parties may choose to meet as often as they wish with their <a href="m_mat.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('m_mat.shtml'); return false;">consultant attorneys</a> and other experts such as appraisers and CPAs. In this way, you retain control, agreeing only to a property division that you feel is fair. Furthermore, by avoiding the <a href="l_costs.shtml" onClick="wintasticsecond('l_costs.shtml'); return false;">cost</a> of litigation, the total professional fees for dividing your property will be considerably lower in mediation.</p>
	<p class="text">Couples frequently argue or withdraw when they try to talk to each other about a division of property. Our skilled and experienced mediators will help you through such an impasse by reviewing options such as:</p>
	<ul class="bulletv1">
	<li><span class="basictextbold">Cash buyout.</span> One party can acquire an item by purchasing the other party's interest in that item. <i>Example: the wife pays the husband $35,000 from her separate property for an undivided interest in her (marital property) company pension.</i></li>
	<li><span class="basictextbold">Sale or liquidation.</span> Some or all of the marital estate can be sold and the proceeds allocated. <i>Example: the vacation home is sold for $92,000 in equity after paying the balance on the mortgage and real-estate fees.</i></li>
	<li><span class="basictextbold">Barter or in-kind exchange.</span> Each party takes certain marital property in exchange for yielding an interest in other items. <i>Example: the husband gains exclusive ownership of the truck and sailboat in exchange for the minivan and the household furnishings.</i></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Dividing Marital Property</h2>
	<p class="text">Identifying what&rsquo;s marital property and what&rsquo;s non-marital property is the easy part in most cases. For example, the wife&rsquo;s Steinway piano inherited from her grand-<br>father during her marriage is her separate non-marital property (unless she gifted it to her husband), whereas at least a portion of any retirement accounts funded from either spouse&rsquo;s income during the marriage will be marital property.</p>
	<p class="text">Missouri courts generally undertake a three-step process in determining an equitable division of marital property: (a) identify the marital (and non-marital) property in the estate; (b) value each asset and liability; (c) distribute the marital property in a fair manner in accordance with Chapter 452 <a href="http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C400-499/4520000330.HTM" rel="nofollow" onClick="wintasticthirdparty('http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C400-499/4520000330.HTM'); return false;">&sect;330</a> of the Missouri Revised Statutes. The section lists multiple factors for consideration, including:</p>
	<ul class="bulletv1">
		<li>The economic circumstances of each spouse at the time the division of property becomes effective, including the desirability of awarding the family home or the right to live therein for reasonable periods to the spouse having custody of any children.</li>
		<li>The contribution of each spouse to the acquisition of the marital property, including the contribution of a spouse as homemaker.</li>
		<li>The value of the non-marital property set apart to each spouse.</li>

	<p class="text">In determining an equitable distribution of marital property, the judge should consider the following:</p>
	<ul class="bulletv1">
	<li>Monetary and non-monetary contributions to the well-being of the family.</li>
	<li>The value of all property interests of each party.</li>

	<p class="text">Although the Maryland courts can order a transfer of an ownership interest in a retirement plan from one party to the other, the court cannot order a transfer of title of real estate or other personal property.

	  fairness in the actual property distribution. The monetary award thereby compen-<br>
