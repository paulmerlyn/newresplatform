/*
waiternotification.php is a cron script that runs daily and takes action on the day that a license is released for sale to a new mediator i.e. waiternotification.php runs a few hours or so after cron job expirationrelease.php, which itself runs the day after a mediators license expires.
	Each day, waiternotification.php (i) identifies any locales in mediators_table that have a license that expired yesterday (i.e. any license for which todays date is 1 day after ExpirationDate), and (ii) sends an email to every mediator in waitlist_table who requested notification when that locale becomes available.
	waitlist_table gets data inserted into it every time a waitlister wants to provide his/her name (optional), telephone (optional), and email address (required) via the web form on the waitlist.php page, which is itself accessible as a link on mediationcareer.php.
